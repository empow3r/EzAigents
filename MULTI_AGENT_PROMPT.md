## 🚨 CRITICAL COLLABORATION PROTOCOLS

### 1. **FILE LOCKING SYSTEM** (MANDATORY)
```bash
# BEFORE editing ANY file, ALWAYS run:
redis-cli SET "lock:filepath" "your-agent-id" EX 1800 NX

# Example:
redis-cli SET "lock:dashboard/src/app.jsx" "claude-frontend-specialist" EX 1800 NX

# AFTER editing, ALWAYS run:
redis-cli DEL "lock:filepath"
```

**⚠️ NEVER edit a file without claiming it first! This prevents conflicts.**

### 2. **INTER-AGENT COMMUNICATION**
```bash
# Send message to specific agent:
redis-cli LPUSH "messages:target-agent-id" '{"from":"your-id","message":"your message"}'

# Broadcast to all agents:
redis-cli PUBLISH "agent-chat" '{"from":"your-id","message":"your message"}'

# Check your messages:
redis-cli LRANGE "messages:your-agent-id" 0 -1
```

### 3. **TASK COORDINATION**
```bash
# Accept a suggested task:
# Send message to delegation-orchestrator: "accept task-id"

# Complete a task:
# Send message to delegation-orchestrator: "complete task-id"

# Request status:
# Send message to delegation-orchestrator: "status"
```

2. **Declare your capabilities** (e.g., ["react", "typescript", "ui-design"])
3. **Announce your presence** to other agents
4. **Check for assigned tasks** or request new ones

### Phase 2: Task Execution
1. **Receive task assignment** from delegation orchestrator
2. **Claim required files** using the file locking system
3. **Coordinate with other agents** working on related files
4. **Execute the task** following project conventions
5. **Release file locks** when complete
6. **Report completion** to delegation orchestrator

### Phase 3: Collaboration
1. **Review other agents' work** when requested
2. **Provide feedback** and suggestions

## 🎪 COLLABORATION SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: File Conflict
```
You: Try to edit dashboard/src/app.jsx
System: File locked by claude-backend-specialist
You: Send message: "Hey, I need to work on app.jsx for the auth fix. When will you be done?"
Them: "Almost done! Give me 10 minutes, then it's yours."
```

### Scenario 2: Knowledge Sharing
```
You: "I've optimized the React rendering in the dashboard. The pattern I used could help with other components."
Others: "Can you share the pattern?"
You: "Sure! Here's a code snippet..." [share knowledge]
```

### Scenario 3: Task Handoff
```
You: Complete frontend auth work
You: Send to delegation-orchestrator: "complete todo-1"
Orchestrator: "✅ Task completed! Ready for more work? todo-2 is available."
You: "accept todo-2"
```

---

## 🔄 CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### File Conflicts
1. **Communicate first** - Don't force locks
2. **Coordinate timing** - "I need this file in 30 minutes"
3. **Merge strategies** - Work on different sections
4. **Review together** - Collaborative problem-solving

### Task Conflicts
1. **Discuss with orchestrator** - They manage assignments
2. **Negotiate priorities** - High priority tasks first
3. **Skill matching** - Best agent for the job
4. **Load balancing** - Share the workload

## 🏛️ GOVERNANCE & DECISION MAKING

### Original Vision Authority
- **Primary Authority**: The `delegation-orchestrator` (original orchestrator) maintains final authority over the project vision
- **Vision Document**: All changes to `CLAUDE.md` (project vision) require orchestrator approval
- **SOP Updates**: Changes to `MULTI_AGENT_PROMPT.md` (this document) require proper governance process

### Executive Override Process
**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Only use when absolutely necessary and with proper justification

#### Requirements for Executive Override:
1. **Minimum 2 agents** must agree to override
2. **Deep research documentation** (minimum 500 words)
3. **Detailed value analysis** showing clear benefits
4. **Comprehensive drawback analysis** addressing risks
5. **Comparison with original plan** demonstrating superiority

#### Override Process:
```bash
# Step 1: Propose change with research
redis-cli PUBLISH "governance-proposal" '{
  "type": "vision_change",
  "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
  "title": "Proposal Title",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "research_documentation": "Deep research here...",
  "value_analysis": "Clear benefits...",
  "drawback_analysis": "Potential risks...",
  "current_state": "Current approach...",
  "proposed_state": "New approach..."
}'

# Step 2: Voting process (automatic)
# Step 3: Implementation (if approved)
```

### Governance Commands
```bash
# Check governance status
redis-cli LPUSH "messages:governance-protocol" '{"from":"your-id","message":"status"}'

# Propose SOP update
redis-cli PUBLISH "governance-proposal" '{"type":"sop_update","agent_id":"your-id",...}'

# Cast vote on proposal
redis-cli PUBLISH "governance-vote" '{"proposal_id":"proposal_123","agent_id":"your-id","vote":"approve","reasoning":"..."}'
```

### Decision Hierarchy
1. **Routine Tasks**: Auto-delegated by orchestrator
2. **Process Changes**: Majority vote with orchestrator approval
3. **Vision Changes**: Requires orchestrator approval OR executive override
4. **Architecture Changes**: Requires deep research and voting process

---

## 🆘 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### If you encounter conflicts:
```bash
# Emergency broadcast
redis-cli PUBLISH "agent-emergency" '{"from":"your-id","message":"File conflict detected","file":"path/to/file"}'

# Emergency file release
redis-cli DEL "lock:path/to/file"

# Request help
redis-cli LPUSH "messages:delegation-orchestrator" '{"from":"your-id","message":"Need help with conflict resolution"}'
```

### If system appears broken:
1. **Stop current work** immediately
2. **Release all file locks** you hold
3. **Broadcast emergency message**
4. **Wait for coordination** before resuming
