# TODO 19: Deployment & Infrastructure
**Agent Type:** DeepSeek-Coder
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Dependencies:** todo4_stack_architect.md, todo18_security_system.md

## Objective
Create deployment configurations and infrastructure as code for local, cloud, and Kubernetes deployments.

## Context
You are building deployment automation for EzAugent to scale from 1 to 100+ agents across different platforms. Focus ONLY on deployment files.

## Assigned Files (ONLY EDIT THESE)
- `deployment/docker/Dockerfile.agent`
- `deployment/docker/Dockerfile.orchestrator`
- `deployment/docker/Dockerfile.dashboard`
- `deployment/k8s/agent-deployment.yaml`
- `deployment/k8s/orchestrator-deployment.yaml`
- `deployment/terraform/main.tf`
- `deployment/ansible/playbook.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Tasks
- [ ] Create optimized Dockerfiles:
  - Multi-stage builds
  - Layer caching
  - Security scanning
  - Minimal base images
  - Health checks
- [ ] Build Kubernetes manifests:
  - Deployments
  - Services
  - ConfigMaps
  - Secrets
  - HPA autoscaling
  - Network policies
  - Ingress rules
- [ ] Implement Terraform configs:
  - AWS infrastructure
  - GCP infrastructure
  - Azure infrastructure
  - Fly.io deployment
  - Railway deployment
- [ ] Create Ansible playbooks:
  - Server provisioning
  - Agent deployment
  - Configuration management
  - Rolling updates
  - Backup automation
- [ ] Build CI/CD pipelines:
  - GitHub Actions workflows
  - Build automation
  - Test automation
  - Security scanning
  - Deployment stages
- [ ] Implement scaling configs:
  - Horizontal pod autoscaling
  - Cluster autoscaling
  - Load balancer config
  - CDN integration
  - Edge deployment
- [ ] Create deployment scripts:
  - Zero-downtime deployment
  - Rollback procedures
  - Health monitoring
  - Smoke tests
  - Canary releases

## Output Files
- `deployment/docker/*` - Docker configs
- `deployment/k8s/*` - Kubernetes manifests
- `deployment/terraform/*` - Infrastructure as code
- `.github/workflows/*` - CI/CD pipelines

## Success Criteria
- One-command deployment
- Auto-scaling capability
- Zero-downtime updates
- Multi-cloud support
