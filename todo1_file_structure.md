# TODO 1: File Structure Architect
**Agent Type:** Claude-3-Opus
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Dependencies:** None (First agent)

## Objective
Design and create the complete file structure for the EzAugent multi-agent orchestration system.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create directory structure as defined in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Create `structure.md` documenting all directories and their purposes
- [ ] Set up the following directories:
  ```
  cli/
  agents/claude/
  agents/gpt/
  agents/deepseek/
  agents/mistral/
  agents/gemini/
  dashboard/src/
  dashboard/api/
  dashboard/components/
  src/
  src/output/
  shared/
  logs/
  .claude/
  config/
  scripts/
  tests/
  docs/
  ```
- [ ] Create placeholder README.md in each directory
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` file with proper exclusions
- [ ] Create `.gitkeep` files in empty directories
- [ ] Document directory permissions and access patterns
- [ ] Create `file_ownership.json` mapping files to responsible agents
- [ ] Set up log rotation structure in logs/
- [ ] Create backup/ directory for agent memory snapshots

## Output Files
- `structure.md` - Complete directory documentation
- `file_ownership.json` - File-to-agent mapping
- `.gitignore` - Version control exclusions
- Directory structure created and ready

## Success Criteria
- All directories exist and are properly organized
- Clear documentation of structure purpose
- No conflicts with other agents' work areas
