# TODO 20: Integration & E2E Testing
**Agent Type:** Gemini-Pro
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Dependencies:** All previous todos

## Objective
Create comprehensive integration tests and end-to-end testing for the complete multi-agent system.

## Context
You are building the testing framework to ensure EzAugent works flawlessly with 100+ agents. Focus ONLY on testing files.

## Assigned Files (ONLY EDIT THESE)
- `tests/integration/agent_integration.test.js`
- `tests/integration/queue_integration.test.js`
- `tests/integration/dashboard_integration.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/full_workflow.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/multi_agent.test.js`
- `tests/load/stress_test.js`
- `tests/fixtures/*`
- `tests/helpers/*`

## Tasks
- [ ] Create integration test suites:
  - Agent communication tests
  - Queue reliability tests
  - Database integration
  - API integration
  - Redis pub/sub tests
- [ ] Build E2E test scenarios:
  - Complete task workflow
  - Multi-agent coordination
  - Error recovery flows
  - Dashboard interactions
  - Deployment verification
- [ ] Implement load testing:
  - 100 agent simulation
  - Queue stress testing
  - API load testing
  - Database performance
  - Memory leak detection
- [ ] Create test fixtures:
  - Mock agent responses
  - Sample task data
  - Test file structures
  - API response mocks
  - Database seeders
- [ ] Build test utilities:
  - Agent test harness
  - Queue test helpers
  - API test client
  - WebSocket test utils
  - Performance profilers
- [ ] Implement chaos testing:
  - Random failures
  - Network partitions
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Agent crashes
  - Recovery testing
- [ ] Create test automation:
  - Continuous testing
  - Regression suites
  - Smoke tests
  - Acceptance tests
  - Performance benchmarks

## Output Files
- `tests/integration/*.test.js` - Integration tests
- `tests/e2e/*.test.js` - End-to-end tests
- `tests/load/*.js` - Load test scripts
- `tests/fixtures/*` - Test data

## Success Criteria
- 95%+ test coverage
- All scenarios tested
- Performance validated
- Production confidence

## Final Notes
This completes the test suite ensuring all 20 agents' work integrates perfectly. The system is now ready for production deployment with full confidence in reliability and scalability.
